 ### Java Primitives and Control Flow

- Methods -

1. pluralize() method accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
2. Flipping Coins() method accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Then it simulates coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. The method prints out heads or tails on one line for each flip.
3. clock() method uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program runs until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time is only be printed once. The program detects when the seconds increase and only prints something out when the timestamp changes.
